The content of this debian package comes from:

https://archiva.apache.org/download.cgi (Standalone version)

To upgrade from 2.0.0 to 2.2.3 I did the following:

* Replace the content of the old release with the new one (a simple cp is fine).
  Pay particular attention to the apps and lib directories, since simply copying
  would leave multiple versions of the same jar (so wipe those dirs first to be
  sure).

* Verify the versions of the jars in archiva.install, they need to match with
  what present in lib.

The following command worked fine to build the package from the build host:

GIT_PBUILDER_AUTOCONF=no DIST=stretch-wikimedia WIKIMEDIA=yes \
    gbp buildpackage -sa -us -uc --git-builder=git-pbuilder

Note: the master branch needs to be tagged correctly to generate the orig.tar.gz
      file (in this case, a tag named 'upstream/2.2.3' for the last commit in
      master was enough).
