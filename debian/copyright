License: CPL-1.0
 LICENSE
 .
 Common Public License Version 1.0
 .
 THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON
 PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
 THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
 .
 1. DEFINITIONS
 .
 "Contribution" means:
 .
     a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
     documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
 .
     b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
 .
     i) changes to the Program, and
 .
     ii) additions to the Program;
 .
     where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
     and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
     'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
     such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's
     behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program
     which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
     conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,
     and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
 .
 "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
 .
 "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
 which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution
 alone or when combined with the Program.
 .
 "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
 Agreement.
 .
 "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
 Agreement, including all Contributors.
 .
 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
 .
     a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
     grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
     copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,
     publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the
     Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative
     works, in source code and object code form.
 .
     b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
     grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
     license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
     import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such
     Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This
     patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution
     and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the
     Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such
     combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent
     license shall not apply to any other combinations which include
     the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
 .
     c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
     licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
     provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
     patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
     Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
     brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
     property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
     rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
     assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
     property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
     patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the
     Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
     before distributing the Program.
 .
     d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
     sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
     the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
 .
 3. REQUIREMENTS
 .
 A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
 under its own license agreement, provided that:
 .
     a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;
     and
 .
     b) its license agreement:
 .
     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
     for a particular purpose;
 .
     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
 .
     iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
     are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party;
     and
 .
     iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
     Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a
     reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for
     software exchange.
 .
 When the Program is made available in source code form:
 .
     a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
 .
     b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
     Program.
 .
 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
 within the Program.
 .
 Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
 Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
 Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
 .
 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
 .
 Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
 responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
 like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use
 of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
 commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
 create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
 Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
 such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
 and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor")
 against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising
 from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party
 against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts
 or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
 distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
 obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
 relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
 infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)
 promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,
 and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with
 the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
 negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
 claim at its own expense.
 .
 For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
 product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
 Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
 claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
 claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
 alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
 defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
 performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
 Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
 must pay those damages.
 .
 5. NO WARRANTY
 .
 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
 PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
 KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
 WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
 OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
 responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
 distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
 exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to
 the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable
 laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
 unavailability or interruption of operations.
 .
 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
 .
 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
 ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
 INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
 WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
 LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
 NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
 DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
 HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. GENERAL
 .
 If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
 applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
 the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
 action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
 minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
 .
 If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with
 respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or
 counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that
 Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as
 of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient
 institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
 cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
 itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
 hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
 rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
 litigation is filed.
 .
 All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
 fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
 Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
 time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
 rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
 and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably
 practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and
 any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall
 continue and survive.
 .
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
 but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
 may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
 reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
 this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
 Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial
 Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the
 Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of
 the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The
 Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to
 the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,
 after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may
 elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under
 the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
 above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual
 property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly,
 by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
 expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
 .
 This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
 the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
 party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement
 more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives
 its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

 hereby grants you a fully-paid, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide,
 limited license (without the right to sublicense), under Licensor's applicable
 intellectual property rights to view, download, use and reproduce the
 Specification only for the purpose of internal evaluation. This includes
 developing applications intended to run on an implementation of the
 Specification provided that such applications do not themselves implement any
 portion(s) of the Specification.
 .
 2. License for the Distribution of Compliant Implementations. Licensor also
 grants you a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, fully
 paid-up, royalty free, limited license (without the right to sublicense) under

 Specification, other than to the extent of your fair use rights, or
 distributing the Specification to third parties).
 .
 3. Pass-through Conditions. You need not include limitations (a)-(c) from the
 previous paragraph or any other particular "pass through" requirements in any
 license You grant concerning the use of your Independent Implementation or
 products derived from it. However, except with respect to Independent
 Implementations (and products derived from them) that satisfy limitations
 (a)-(c) from the previous paragraph, You may neither: (a) grant or otherwise
 pass through to your licensees any licenses under Licensor's applicable
 intellectual property rights; nor (b) authorize your licensees to make any
 claims concerning their implementation's compliance with the Specification.
 .

 .
 6. Termination. This Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from
 Licensor if you fail to comply with any material provision of or act outside
 the scope of the licenses granted above.
 .
 7. Trademarks. No right, title, or interest in or to any trademarks, service
 marks, or trade names of Licensor is granted hereunder. Java is a registered
 trademark of Sun Microsystems, Inc. in the United States and other countries.
 .
 8. Disclaimer of Warranties. The Specification is provided "AS IS". LICENSOR
 MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING
 BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT (INCLUDING AS A CONSEQUENCE OF ANY PRACTICE OR
 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SPECIFICATION), OR THAT THE CONTENTS OF THE
 SPECIFICATION ARE SUITABLE FOR ANY PURPOSE. This document does not represent
 any commitment to release or implement any portion of the Specification in any
 product.
 .
 The Specification could include technical inaccuracies or typographical
 errors. Changes are periodically added to the information therein; these
 changes will be incorporated into new versions of the Specification, if any.
 Licensor may make improvements and/or changes to the product(s) and/or the
 program(s) described in the Specification at any time. Any use of such changes
 in the Specification will be governed by the then-current license for the
 applicable version of the Specification.
 .
 9. Limitation of Liability. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT
 WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST
 REVENUE, PROFITS OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL
 OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY,
 ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO ANY FURNISHING, PRACTICING, MODIFYING OR ANY USE
 OF THE SPECIFICATION, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
 SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 10. Report. If you provide Licensor with any comments or suggestions in
 connection with your use of the Specification ("Feedback"), you hereby: (i)
 agree that such Feedback is provided on a non-proprietary and non-confidential
 basis, and (ii) grant Licensor a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully
 paid-up, irrevocable license, with the right to sublicense through multiple
 levels of sublicensees, to incorporate, disclose, and use without limitation
 the Feedback for any purpose related to the Specification and future versions,
 implementations, and test suites thereof.
 .
 In addition to the permissions granted under the Specification
 License, Day Management AG hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 license to reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform,

 .
 With respect to any patent claims covered by this license
 that would be infringed by all technically feasible implementations
 of the Specification, such license is conditioned upon your
 offering on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms,
 to any party seeking it from You, a perpetual, non-exclusive,
 non-transferable, worldwide license under Your patent rights
 that are or would be infringed by all technically feasible

 Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that
 Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You
 must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of
 the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must
 inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how
 they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable
 manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
 .
 3.2. Modifications.
 .
 The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by
 the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications
 are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the
 rights conveyed by this License.
 .
 3.3. Required Notices.
 .
 You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as
 the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any
 copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software,
 or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any
 Contributor or the Initial Developer.
 .
 3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
 .
 You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code
 form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
 recipientsâ rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee
 for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
 recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own
 behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
 must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
 liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to
 indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
 incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
 support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
 .
 3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
 .
 You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms
 of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may
 contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance
 with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form
 does not attempt to limit or alter the recipientâs rights in the Source Code
 form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
 Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it
 absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by
 You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to
 indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
 incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
 terms You offer.
 .
 3.6. Larger Works.
 .
 You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not
 governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a
 single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this
 License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.
 .
 4. Versions of the License.
 .
 4.1. New Versions.
 .
 Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised
 and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be
 given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no
 one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.
 .
 4.2. Effect of New Versions.
 .
 You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
 Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which
 You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer
 includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being
 distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the
 License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the
 terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the
 Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or
 otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any
 subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.
 .
 4.3. Modified Versions.
 .
 When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for
 Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this
 License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name
 of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this
 License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms
 which differ from this License.
 .
 5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
 .
 COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN âAS ISâ BASIS, WITHOUT
 WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
 LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
 MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK
 AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD
 ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL
 DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY
 SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
 ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED
 HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
 .
 6. TERMINATION.
 .
 6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
 automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such
 breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by
 their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
 shall survive.
 .
 6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment
 actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or
 Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as
 âParticipantâ) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor
 Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where
 the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any
 patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such
 Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the
 Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this
 License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively
 and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if
 within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
 Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant
 to a written agreement with Participant.
 .
 6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user
 licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
 prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)
 shall survive termination.
 .
 7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
 .
 UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
 NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
 OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF
 ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
 INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
 LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
 COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
 LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH
 OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYâS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
 APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
 EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
 EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
 .
 The Covered Software is a âcommercial item,â as that term is defined in 48
 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of âcommercial computer softwareâ (as
 that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. Â§ 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and âcommercial
 computer software documentationâ as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212
 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1
 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered
 Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights
 clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or
 provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this
 License.
 .
 9. MISCELLANEOUS.
 .
 This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
 hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
 provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
 enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction
 specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the
 extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such
 jurisdictionâs conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this
 License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the
 jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original
 Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
 limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneysâ fees and expenses. The
 application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
 International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which
 provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
 drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are
 responsible for compliance with the United States export administration
 regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other
 countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered
 Software.
 .
 10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
 .
 As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
 for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization
 of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and
 Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
 herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of
 liability.

License: EPL-1.0
 THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
 LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
 CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
 .
 1. DEFINITIONS
 .
 "Contribution" means:
 .
 a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
 distributed under this Agreement, and b) in the case of each subsequent
 Contributor: i) changes to the Program, and ii) additions to the Program;
 where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
 distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
 Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or
 anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include
 additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software
 distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,
 and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. "Contributor" means any
 person or entity that distributes the Program.
 .
 "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
 necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
 combined with the Program.
 .
 "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
 Agreement.
 .
 "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
 including all Contributors.
 .
 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
 .
 a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
 Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
 reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
 distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and
 such derivative works, in source code and object code form. b) Subject to the
 terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a
 non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents
 to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
 Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.
 This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
 Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
 addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
 Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
 which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. c)
 Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to
 its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
 Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other
 intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims
 any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on
 infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
 exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
 assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
 needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to
 allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to
 acquire that license before distributing the Program. d) Each Contributor
 represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its
 Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this
 Agreement. 3. REQUIREMENTS
 .
 A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under
 its own license agreement, provided that:
 .
 a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and b) its
 license agreement: i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
 warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
 conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions
 of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; ii) effectively
 excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including
 direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost
 profits; iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
 offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and iv) states
 that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and
 informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a
 medium customarily used for software exchange. When the Program is made
 available in source code form:
 .
 a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and b) a copy of this
 Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. Contributors may not
 remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.
 .
 Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,
 if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify
 the originator of the Contribution.
 .
 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
 .
 Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
 respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
 intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
 includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
 which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,
 if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
 Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
 every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
 damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and
 other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
 Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial
 Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial
 product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims
 or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
 infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)
 promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)
 allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial
 Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The
 Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
 .
 For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
 offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If
 that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers
 warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are
 such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
 Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
 Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a
 court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the
 Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
 .
 5. NO WARRANTY
 .
 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
 "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
 IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
 NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
 Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using
 and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
 exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the
 risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to
 or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of
 operations.
 .
 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
 .
 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
 CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
 SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
 LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
 CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
 ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
 EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
 OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. GENERAL
 .
 If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
 applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
 remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the
 parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
 necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
 .
 If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
 cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
 (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
 infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted
 under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
 .
 All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
 comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
 not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
 such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
 Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
 reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
 and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
 and survive.
 .
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
 order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
 modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
 publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to
 time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this
 Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The
 Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement
 Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will
 be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
 Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the
 Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the
 Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program
 (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly
 stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or
 licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,
 whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the
 Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
 .
 This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
 intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
 Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
 after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial
 in any resulting litigation.
